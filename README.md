# Getting Started with Create React App
This project is for replicating the step 1-6 guide of Carbon Design but for version 17.

This project was created following this [Create React App](https://medium.com/carbondesign/up-running-with-carbon-react-in-less-than-5-minutes-25d43cca059e).
After getting the initial setup working, the steps were followed from IBM's own guide [react-tutorial-carbon-design](https://carbondesignsystem.com/developing/react-tutorial/overview/), and components, structure, etc was changed to make a functioning version.

## Initial steps that may have differed from both guides. 

- npx create-react-app carbon-design
- npm config set legacy-peer-deps true
- then install
  - @carbon/react
  - carbon-components
  - carbon-components-react
  - carbon-icons
